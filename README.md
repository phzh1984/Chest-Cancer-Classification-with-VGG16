# Chest-Cancer-Classification-with-VGG16

This project aims to classify and diagnose chest cancer using machine learning and deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Patients can be classified as having cancer or not, and if cancer is detected, the project provides information about the specific type of cancer and potential treatment options.

Description

This project focuses on the classification and diagnosis of chest cancer using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known as VGG16. Chest cancer encompasses various types of cancers, each with its unique characteristics and symptoms.

Data

The dataset comprises images in JPG or PNG format for compatibility with the model.

The data is categorized into three main chest cancer types:

Adenocarcinoma: The most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 30 percent of all cases and approximately 40 percent of all non-small cell lung cancer cases. Adenocarcinomas are found in various types of cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal.

Large Cell Carcinoma: This aggressive form of lung cancer can be found throughout the lung and typically accounts for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It tends to grow and spread rapidly.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma: This type of lung cancer is typically found in central lung areas, where the larger bronchi connect to the trachea. It accounts for about 30 percent of all non-small cell lung cancers and is closely associated with smoking.

Normal CT-Scan Images: A folder containing images representing a healthy state for comparison.

Dataset Structure

The data is organized within a hierarchical folder structure:

Data: The main folder containing subfolders for training, testing, and validation sets.

Train: The training set, which constitutes 70% of the data.

Test: The testing set, accounting for 20% of the data.

Valid: The validation set, comprising 10% of the data.

Usage

Symptoms of chest cancer can vary among individuals. Common symptoms may include:

Chest pain

Cough that brings up blood (hemoptysis)

Persistent, painful cough

Shortness of breath

Hoarseness

Wheezing

Unexplained lumps of tissue under the skin on the chest

Unexplained weight loss
